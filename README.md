### Description
Programmatically create hunting rules for deserialization exploitation with multiple

- keywords (e.g. cmd.exe)
- gadget chains (e.g. CommonsCollection)
- object types (e.g. ViewState, Java, Python Pickle, PHP)
- encodings (e.g. Base64, raw)
- rule types (e.g. Snort, Yara)

### Disclaimer
Rules generated by this tool are intended for hunting/research purposes and are not designed for high fidelity/blocking purposes.

Please *test thoroughly* before deploying to any production systems.

The Yara rules are primarily intended for scanning web server logs. Some of the "object prefixes" are only 2 bytes long, so they can make large scans a bit slow. _(Translation: please don't drop them all into VT Retrohunt.)_

### Usage
Help:
```python3 heyserial.py -h```

Examples:
```
python3 heyserial.py -c 'ExampleChain::condition1+condition2' -t JavaObj
python3 heyserial.py -k cmd.exe whoami 'This file cannot be run in DOS mode'
python3 heyserial.py -k Process.Start -t NETViewState -e base64 "base64+utf16le"
```

# Utils

### utils/checkyoself.py
This is a tool to automate bulk testing of Snort and Yara rules on a variety of sample files. 

Usage:
```python3 checkyoself.py [-y rules.yara] [-s rules.snort] [-o file_output_prefix] [--matches] [--misses] -d malware.exe malware.pcap```

Examples:
```python3 checkyoself.py -y rules/javaobj -s rules/javaobj -d payloads/javaobj pcaps --misses -o java_misses```

### utils/generate_payloads.ps1
YSoSerial.NET v1.34 payload generation. Run on Windows from the ./utils directory. https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net

### utils/generate_payloads.sh
YSoSerial payload generation. Run on Linux from the ./utils directory. https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial

### utils/install_snort.sh
Installing Snort on a Debian based system was a bit finnicky for me, so I wrote my install notes here. 

_Use at your own risk *in a VM* that *you have snapshotted recently*._

### utils/server.py
Simple Python script that runs an HTTP server on 127.0.0.1:12345 and accepts POST requests. 

Handy for generating test PCAPs.
